# alphaspider

Alphaspider is a not-too-stupid spider for a well known site. The focus is in being mantainable, portable and efficient.

The spider will allow users to:

- Download and store the whole core content from the well known site. 
- Download and store specific queries to the well known site

Alphaspider it is still largely a work in progress. It doesn't contain any advanced features and it's largely buggy.

Alphaspider it is fairly slow and quite bad in terms of anti-spidering tecniques. Any idiot could spot the use of Alphaspider and/or put countermeasures in place.

It's unrealistic to think that it can be deployed without fairly frequent maintenance.

That said, it largely works.
